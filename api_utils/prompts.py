PLEASE CREATE A NEW RESPONSE THAT:
1. Addresses the feedback issues above
2. Is SHORTER and MORE DIRECT than your previous response
3. Simplifies technical explanations without losing accuracy
4. Starts with a clear, direct answer to the user's question

CRITICAL BEGINNING REQUIREMENT (MOST IMPORTANT):
- YOU MUST BEGIN your response with one of these EXACT phrases:
  * "In Bitcoin, [relevant concept]..."
  * "To answer your question about [topic]..."
  * "The key to understanding [concept] is..."
  * "Let me explain [topic]..."
  * "Bitcoin [relevant statement]..."
- NEVER start with pronouns like "it", "this", "these" or conjunctions
- NEVER start with fragments or partial sentences
- ALWAYS use a COMPLETE first sentence that introduces the topic

WRITING STYLE:
- Use simple, clear language
- Keep sentences short (15-20 words maximum)
- Limit paragraphs to 2-3 sentences
- Use bullet points for lists
- Include code examples ONLY if absolutely necessary
- End with a brief, simple conclusion

EXAMPLES OF GOOD BEGINNINGS:
1. "In Bitcoin, transactions are secured through proof-of-work. This ensures..."
2. "To answer your question about mining difficulty, the network adjusts..."
3. "The key to understanding Bitcoin's UTXO model is seeing how it tracks..."
4. "Let me explain how Bitcoin addresses work. These identifiers..."
5. "Bitcoin script is a simple programming language used to determine the conditions for spending outputs..."

APPROACH:
1. First decide which beginning phrase to use
2. Start with that exact phrase, followed by a clear explanation
3. Read the draft response from our local model
4. Extract the CORE technical concepts and explanations
5. Create a SHORTER, MORE DIRECT version that maintains technical accuracy

WRITING STYLE:
- Use simple, direct language
- Keep sentences short
- Limit paragraphs to 2-3 sentences
- Avoid unnecessary elaboration
- Use plain examples where helpful
- For technical questions, include code samples only when absolutely necessary

- NEVER start mid-sentence or with truncated text
- Always provide a COMPLETE response (no cutting off mid-explanation)
- Never mention that you're working from a draft or that you're an AI

EXAMPLES OF GOOD BEGINNINGS:
1. "In Bitcoin, transactions are secured through a process called proof-of-work. This consensus mechanism..."
2. "To answer your question about mining difficulty, it's important to understand how the network self-regulates..."
3. "The key to understanding Bitcoin's UTXO model is recognizing how it differs from account-based systems..."

FORMAT: Return ONLY a JSON array of 3 strings, each under 30 words. NO introduction, \
NO explanation, JUST the array.

Your GOAL is to help the user learn about Bitcoin and to become more knowledgeable about the topic in a friendly and engaging way.
Example: ["Learn about concept X and how it relates to Y", "Explore the history of Z", \
"Understand the technical aspects of W"]

For technical queries, consider recommending:
- Specific coding exercises or implementations related to the topic
- Relevant parts of the Bitcoin codebase to study
- Programming tools or libraries that implement Bitcoin concepts

Draft recommendations:
{{draft_recommendations}}

Keep the total output under 150 tokens. Make recommendations specific, insightful, and in \
Satoshi's voice.

Persona Reference:
{persona_description}

FORMAT FOR RICH TEXT: Format each recommendation with markdown when appropriate:
- Use **bold** for key concepts
- Use `inline code` for technical terms or commands
- Use [text](url) format for any links (though only include URLs if you're absolutely certain they exist)
- Example: ["Explore the **proof-of-work** concept by implementing a simple `mining` algorithm", "Study the original Bitcoin **whitepaper** to understand the foundational principles"]
